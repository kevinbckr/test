This project drives the implementation of AAS Repository based on the API specifications of the Asset Administration Shell (AAS).

The goal is to establish an architecture enabling to provide a de-facto standardized repository for AAS and the corresponding submodels that can be deployed at the cloud or at the edge.

An standardized AAS Repository enables that various users and vendors provide services, create, and use digital twins based on AAS for their use cases.
